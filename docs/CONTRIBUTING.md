## Reporting a bug

A _bug_ is a behavior or other problem that clearly goes against how things are supposed to be.

[Create an issue](https://github.com/spraakbanken/mink-frontend/issues/new) and add at least the `bug` label.

For an effective bug report:

- describe how to reproduce the behaviour,
  - what is expected to happen and
  - what actually happens
- mention what web browser and OS you are using
- add screenshots if relevant

## Suggesting an enhancement

An _enhancement_ could be a new feature, or another improvement that doesn't classify as a bug.

[Create an issue](https://github.com/spraakbanken/mink-frontend/issues/new) and add at least the `enhancement` label.
