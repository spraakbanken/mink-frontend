## Reporting a bug

A _bug_ is a behavior or other problem that clearly goes against how things are supposed to be.

[Create an issue](https://github.com/spraakbanken/mink-frontend/issues/new) and choose `Bug` for the _Type_ field.

For an effective bug report:

- describe how to reproduce the behaviour,
  - what is expected to happen and
  - what actually happens
- mention what web browser and OS you are using
- add screenshots if relevant

## Suggesting a feature

A _feature_ means new functionality.

[Create an issue](https://github.com/spraakbanken/mink-frontend/issues/new) and choose `Feature` for the _Type_ field.

For an effective feature request:

- describe the end goal
- outline what aspects would be necessary for the feature to be useful to you
- include any further ideas to make it perfect in your eyes
- provide good examples from other projects, if you know any
