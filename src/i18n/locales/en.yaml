Please refer to the Sparv documentation on {topic} for more information.

annotations.info: |
  <p>
    We are working on making it possible to choose among more methods, annotations and models to be used in the analysis.
    At this time, apart from the options above, the analysis will enrich the texts with the following annotations:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Part-of-speech tags</li>
    <li>Morphosyntactic tags</li>
    <li>Base form</li>
    <li>Lemgram</li>
    <li>Saldo sense</li>
    <li>Compound word analysis</li>
    <li>Dependency parsing</li>
    <li>Sentiment analysis</li>
    <li>Lexical classes from SweFN and Blingbring</li>
    <li>Readability values per text</li>
  </ul>
  <p>You can find some more information about the annotations in the 
    <a href="https://spraakbanken.gu.se/sparv/#/user-manual/available-analyses">Sparv documentation</a>.
