  <p>
    We are working on making it possible to choose what methods, annotations and models are used in the analysis.
    At this time, the analysis will enrich the texts with the following annotations:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Part-of-speech tags</li>
    <li>Morphosyntactic tags</li>
    <li>Base form</li>
    <li>Lemgram</li>
    <li>Saldo sense</li>
    <li>Compound word analysis</li>
    <li>Dependency parsing</li>
    <li>Sentiment analysis</li>
    <li>Lexical classes from SweFN and Blingbring</li>
    <li>Readability values per text</li>
  </ul>
  <p>You can find some more information about the annotations in the 
    <a href="https://spraakbanken.gu.se/sparv/#/user-manual/available-analyses">Sparv documentation</a>.
